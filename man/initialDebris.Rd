\title{Preliminary debris classification}
\usage{
initialDebris(x, score = c("simple", "complex", 1), standardize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{SingleCellExperiment} created with \code{\link{readCytof}}.}

\item{score}{A value of "simple", "complex", or "1" that specifies the debris 
score that should be calculated. Note that the score "1" is from the first
release of this package. See details for information on the debris score.}

\item{standardize}{A value of TRUE will compute the debris score 
using standardized data. The raw data will be used to compute the score 
if FALSE. It is highly recommended that the data are standardized prior
to computing the score because the variables are on different scales.}
}
\value{
A \code{SingleCellExperiment} that contains the debris score and the 
debris designation for each event. This information is stored in the 
\code{score} and \code{initial} objects in the colData for the 
\code{SingleCellExperiment}.

\description{
Preliminary debris classification
}
\details{
The beads are typically the first cell classification that is done
because their identification is straightforward. Debris is typically
classified after the beads. This is because classifying debris
is more straightforward than doublets and labeling them before the
doublets aids in doublet classification. 

Different event types are labeled iteratively so the \code{labels}
vector in the colData will contain all of the labels and 
probabilities computed up to this point. Only events that 
have a "cell" label can be assigned an initial event classification of
"debris". This function computes a score that assesses how much an event
looks like debris and then fits a mixture model to assign each event 
a class of 1 for debris, -1 for an event that is not debris, or 0 
for undetermined or previously assigned to a different event type. 
The score is recorded in the \code{score} object in the colData and 
the initial classification is recorded in the \code{initial} part of 
the colData. 

Several options are available for computing the debris score. The
following list shows the debris score calculations. Each one can
be selected by its number on the following list:
\itemize{
  \item{simple: -1 * (2 * DNA + Event_length)}
  \item{complex: -1 * (2 * DNA + Event_length - Offset - Width)}
  \item{1: 1 - (2 * DNA + Event_length - Center - Width + Offset)}
}
Note that there were three scores released with the original version of this
package that were labeled "1", "2", and "3". Score "1" is the same score and 
works fairly well. Scores "2" and "3" were found to be poor scores based
on further analysis so they are not included in this version of the package.
