#' Preliminary bead classification
#'
#' @param x A \code{SingleCellExperiment} created with \code{\link{readCytof}}. 
#'
#' @return A \code{SingleCellExperiment} that contains the bead score and the 
#' bead designation for each event. This information is stored in the 
#' \code{score} and \code{initial} objects in the colData for the 
#' \code{SingleCellExperiment}. 
#'
#' @details
#' The beads are typically the first cell classification that is done. The
#' different event types are labeled iteratively so the \code{labels}
#' vector in the colData will contain all of the labels and 
#' probabilities computed up to this point. Only events that 
#' have a "cell" label can be assigned an initial event classification of
#' "bead". This function computes a score that assesses how much an event
#' looks like a bead and then fits a mixture model to assign each event 
#' a class of 1 for a bead, -1 for an event that is not a bead, or 0 
#' for undetermined or previously assigned to a different event type. 
#' The score is recorded in the \code{score} object in the colData and 
#' the initial classification is recorded in the \code{initial} part of 
#' the colData. 
#' 
#' Each bead channel should classify into two fairly clear groups where one
#' is the beads and the other is non-beads. A histogram of the bead score
#' should show a clear, small peak that represents the beads.
